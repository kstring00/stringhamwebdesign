/**
 * One place that decides what SUPABASE_URL means.
 *
 * The value must be the bare project URL. Every caller appends its own API
 * prefix — `/rest/v1/<resource>` for PostgREST, `/storage/v1/...` for Storage —
 * so a SUPABASE_URL that already ends in `/rest/v1` yields
 * `/rest/v1/rest/v1/<resource>`, which PostgREST rejects with PGRST125
 * ("Invalid path specified in request URL") on *every* request.
 *
 * That misconfiguration cost a full debugging session: the webhook answered 200
 * throughout, because the failure was caught and discarded well below the
 * response. So the suffix is stripped here rather than left to fail — but it is
 * never stripped silently. `supabaseUrlWarning` is printed loudly once at server
 * start by `instrumentation.ts`, so the env value still gets fixed at source
 * instead of quietly depending on this correction forever.
